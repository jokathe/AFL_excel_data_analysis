The project involved selecting a relevant dataset and deriving insights using Excel as the primary tool. I utilised pivot tables to compare data, identify patterns, and summarise key information about games, 
players, and statistics. Additionally, I applied descriptive and predictive analysis techniques to forecast future performance and conducted regression analysis to examine correlations between players’ physical 
attributes, such as age and weight, and their performance. The final deliverable was an interactive AFL dashboard to visualise relevant information of all files and further written analysis.
